We propose a decentralized UTM protocol that controls access to
airspace while ensuring high levels of integrity, availability, and
confidentiality of airspace operations. To achieve this, we exploit
key features of the blockchain and smart contract technologies.
In addition, we employ a mobile crowdsensing (MCS) mechanism
to seamlessly enforce airspace rules and regulations that govern
the UAV operations. The solution is implemented on top of
the Etheruem platform and verified using four different smart
contract verification tools.
